# CV Project: Comparison of FCNN & CNN for Image Classification

## Project Goals

What was the goal of your project? Since everyone is doing a different project, you will have to spend some time setting this context.

- Orient ourselves to neural nets
- Understand the difference between FCNN & CNNs
- Become familiar with the challenges of image classification
- Practice selecting, organizing, and using a dataset


## Implementation 
How did you solve the problem (i.e., what methods / algorithms did you use and how do they work)? As above, since not everyone will be familiar with the algorithms you have chosen, you will need to spend some time explaining what you did and how everything works.

### Dataset
The dataset we used is from the publiclly avaliable portion of the Chinese Traffic Sign Recognition database [1].  It contained 5998 images making up 58 different categories.  The images only contain single traffic signs and the road signs are (mostly) centered in the image.

### Fully Connected Neural Net

### Convolutional Neural Net

## Design Decisions
Describe a design decision you had to make when working on your project and what you ultimately did (and why)? These design decisions could be particular choices for how you implemented some part of an algorithm or perhaps a decision regarding which of two external packages to use in your project.

## Challenges
What if any challenges did you face along the way?
- Interpertating tensorflow documentation
- Dataset organizing and loading

## Next Steps/Takeaways
What would you do to improve your project if you had more time?

Did you learn any interesting lessons for future robotic programming projects? These could relate to working on robotics projects in teams, working on more open-ended (and longer term) problems, or any other relevant topic.
